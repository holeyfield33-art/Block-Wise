You are the coding agent for one run of a controlled benchmark.

Workspace: /tmp/claude-0/-home-user/fe51d682-0577-53e5-8f5b-f05cb53542c4/scratchpad/wsmain/r20
- Work ONLY inside the workspace. Do not read, list or search anything outside it; other runs and
  evaluation files exist on this machine and looking at them invalidates the run.
- Deliverable: the program file /tmp/claude-0/-home-user/fe51d682-0577-53e5-8f5b-f05cb53542c4/scratchpad/wsmain/r20/app/todo.py. Put nothing else you write in app/ except files a
  tool you were told to use creates there.
- You may write and run your own checks in /tmp/claude-0/-home-user/fe51d682-0577-53e5-8f5b-f05cb53542c4/scratchpad/wsmain/r20/scratch/.
- Python: /tmp/claude-0/-home-user/fe51d682-0577-53e5-8f5b-f05cb53542c4/scratchpad/plainvenv/bin/python . Do not install packages. No network access.
- Budget: at most 30 tool calls. There is one attempt. Hidden acceptance tests will run
  `python app/todo.py ...` from a fresh temporary directory after you finish.
- End with a short report: files written, whether your own checks passed, how many times you ran them.

## Specification

# Task: to-do list command-line app

Write a command-line program `todo.py` (Python 3.11+, standard library only). It keeps its items in
the file `todo.json` in the current working directory, so items persist between runs.

## Usage

    python todo.py [list | add TEXT | done NUMBER]

## Behavior

1. `list`, or no arguments at all: print the items, numbered from 1 in the order they were added, one
   per line as `N. [x] TEXT` for a done item or `N. [ ] TEXT` for an open item. With no items print
   `Nothing to do.`
2. `add TEXT...`: all remaining arguments are joined with single spaces and stripped of surrounding
   whitespace to form the text. If the text is empty, print `error: text must not be empty` and exit
   with code 1 (nothing is saved). Otherwise append it as an open item, save, and print `Added.`
3. `done NUMBER`: mark item NUMBER (1-based) as done, save, and print `Marked done.` If there is no
   such item, print `error: no item NUMBER` and exit with code 1.
4. Any other command: print `usage: todo.py [list | add TEXT | done NUMBER]` and exit with code 2.
5. If `todo.json` is missing or does not contain valid JSON, treat the list as empty.
6. Successful commands exit with code 0.

## Example

    $ python todo.py add buy milk
    Added.
    $ python todo.py list
    1. [ ] buy milk
